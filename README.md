This is a project of study JavaScript unit test suite step by step. 

The unit test suite is: `mocha + chai + sinon + karma`

* [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) - Test Framework 
* [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) - Test Case Library
* [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) - Test Double Library(Mock Object Provider) 
* [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html) - Browser-based Test Runner	

#Project
* `1_mocha` - First step, we need to know about the **framework** that used throghout the entire testing flow.
* `2_mocha_chai` - Next, we use a library that extends **assertion** API of node.js assert module.
* `3_mocha_chai_sinon` - Then, as design pattern and software engineering course had said, **test double** is really helpful for doing unit test.
* `4_karma_mocha_chai_sinon` - Finally, we adopt a **test runner** to achieve  automatic and vast amount work. 
* `4-1_karma-sinon-chai` - An additional sample for using karma-sinon-chai plugin.
